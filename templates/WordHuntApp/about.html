	<h3>Game</h3>
	<p>The goal of this game is to find the word randomly generated by this application in the real world, take a picture of it and upload that image to this website. 
	Every user can upload one picture per word. While submiting the picture, the users can provide GPS coordinates of the location where it was taken.</p>
	<p> The points for each picture are awarded based on the rating of the pictures. 
	The images are rated by other users based on the location of the photo, creativity in searching for the word and the effort put into taking the photo.</p>
			
	<h3>The project</h3>
	<p>This website application has been created as part of the Web Application Development course in University of Glasgow by Team A from lab group 6. </p>
